# Heart failures predictions
LELEC2870 - Machine learning : regression, deep networks and dimensionality reduction

*Heart failure is a growing concern in the Smurf society, requiring better predictive models. Existing methods rely on linear models that fail to capture complex interactions, and little research integrates both tabular and image data. This study improves prediction accuracy by combining feature selection, deep learning-based image processing, and optimized models. A custom CNN (CNNDoubleConv) with an SVR model reduced RMSE from 0.08 to 0.0426, a 46.75% improvement. Key risk factors include blood pressure, cholesterol, and diet. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning for early heart failure detection and preventive healthcare strategies.*
